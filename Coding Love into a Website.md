# Coding Love into a Website
It all started when I was brainstorming cute, creative gift ideas for my boyfriend. Sure, I could’ve gone the usual route — buy something, plan a surprise date, or even attempt baking (which, let’s face it, would be a disaster).

But then I thought:  
**“Why not create something really personal?”**  

Enter: learning HTML and CSS!

With **zero coding experience**, I dove into the world of web design, thanks to YouTube tutorials and a lot of Googling. I spent days learning how to make buttons, style text, and add quirky little features. And after countless attempts (and a few breakdowns), I finally created a *super cute* website that asks him:

> **“Do you love me?”**  
> *(with two buttons: Yes and No)*

The catch?  
You can’t actually click **"No"** — it just zooms around the screen, dodging your mouse like it knows it’s lying.  
**Genius, right? 😏**

When I showed him the site, I was **so proud** of myself.

But of course... being the software engineer he is, he immediately broke my website **just to peek at the code**.  
(How rude!)

But hey — he absolutely loved it, so I’ll let it slide.  
The effort totally paid off, and I picked up a fun new skill along the way.

### 💡 Lesson learned:

> When you date a software engineer, *nothing is safe* — not even your cute little code. 😂
