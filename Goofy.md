## GOOFY
## Our cute couple

Lucy was sitting cross-legged on the couch, her laptop open in front of her. The soft glow of the screen was the only light in the room, and she was deep in concentration, trying to wrap up a report that had been hanging over her for days. The hum of the city outside was the usual background noise, but something was different tonight.

Vroom. Vroom.

She glanced toward the window. The faint sound of an engine was steadily growing louder. Lucy narrowed her eyes. She knew exactly what it was.

Max and his damn RC truck.

She could hear the whirring of the tiny wheels, the unmistakable beep beep of the horn as it raced across the living room floor. She shook her head, trying to keep her focus, but it was impossible. The truck came closer, zooming right up to her feet before coming to a dramatic stop.

Lucy looked down, her fingers still on her keyboard, her patience hanging by a thread. There it was, Max’s little blue RC truck, sitting innocently at her feet. But on its roof? A sticky note.

She picked it up, reading it out loud in a mocking tone:

> "Dinner? - Max"

She sighed dramatically, then typed a quick response on her phone.

**Lucy (text):**  
"Max, seriously. I’m working. Can you not?"

Before she could even press send, the truck slowly revved its engine, and then, with a sharp beep, started driving back across the room toward Max. He was sitting on the couch opposite her, trying his best to look innocent, but his goofy grin gave him away immediately.

Lucy raised an eyebrow at him. “You’re using the RC truck to ask me to dinner now?”

Max, still controlling the truck with a tiny controller, shrugged nonchalantly. “What can I say? You were ignoring me. Figured I'd send in a more... tactical approach.”

The truck zipped across the coffee table, narrowly avoiding a stack of papers. Max’s grin got wider when he saw Lucy’s smile despite herself.

Lucy folded her arms, giving him a look. “If you think this is going to get you out of taking me to that new Italian place tonight, you’re mistaken.”

Max’s eyes lit up like he’d just scored a touchdown. “Wait, wait, wait. Does that mean—”

“Maybe,” Lucy said with a half-laugh, leaning back against the couch. “But only if the truck stops interrupting my work.”

Max put his hands up in mock surrender, still holding the controller. “Okay, okay. I’ll stop... for now.”

As if on cue, the truck stopped in its tracks. Max’s expression shifted from playful to dramatically serious. “But, you know,” he added, glancing down at the truck with a grin, “I had one more thing to deliver.”

He set the controller down, then reached over to the coffee table where a small package was hidden under a napkin. He slid it over to her, and Lucy unwrapped it to find a little box of chocolate truffles, the shiny foil catching the dim light of the room.

She stared at it for a moment before meeting his eyes. Max was grinning like he’d just won a prize.

Lucy shook her head, amused. “You’re ridiculous, Max.”

“I know,” he said, his smile wide, “but I got your attention, didn’t I?”

Lucy popped one of the truffles into her mouth, savoring it for a second before responding. “You’re lucky you’re cute.”

Max leaned forward, eagerly watching her. “So? Does this mean... we’re on?”

Lucy clicked her tongue. “On what?”

Max’s voice got louder, like a kid who just had his first successful plan. “On the dinner date! You said maybe, but the chocolate was definitely a yes!”

Lucy burst out laughing, shaking her head. “You really are something.”

Max threw his arms in the air in victory, leaning back into the couch like he’d just won the Super Bowl. “YES! I got a date!”

Lucy rolled her eyes, but her smile softened as she reached for another truffle. “Fine, fine. Dinner’s a yes. But next time? Use the normal door, not the toy truck.”

Max put his hands to his chest in mock offense. “How could you insult my art of romance?” he said dramatically, causing her to laugh even harder.

“Your art of romance is a little chaotic, but I guess I’ll keep you around,” she teased, snuggling into the couch beside him.

Max leaned back, pulling her closer, his grin still stretched across his face. “That’s all I wanted to hear.”

Lucy rolled her eyes again, but this time, her heart was warm. There was something about Max’s unfiltered goofiness that always made her smile, even when he drove her insane with his little RC truck.

The evening settled into a comfortable silence as they ate dinner, Max still occasionally poking her with silly comments and random jokes, while Lucy gave in, laughing and enjoying every moment of his ridiculousness.

The RC truck, however, was safely parked in its corner for now. But Lucy knew—tomorrow, it would probably be making another surprise appearance.

And she was kind of okay with that. :)
