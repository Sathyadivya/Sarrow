# Book Review: *Welcome to Hyunam-dong Bookshop* by Hwang Bo-reum

> “Books are not meant to remain in your mind, but your heart.”

And this book has claimed its place in my heart just like that.

I never thought I would be writing a blog post about a book. It’s not that I don't like reading, but whenever I complete a book, I don’t have a clear opinion on it. Do I like it or not? I just have a vague feeling — like or dislike — but if someone asks me why, or which part I liked, I can’t answer because I don’t know. And when I *do* know, I can’t put those thoughts into words. I don’t know if anyone feels like this, but for me, it is tough.

But this book — for the first time — I can say that I know why and what made me like it.

Imagine this: A cold winter evening, a cozy blanket, and the delightful aroma of a freshly brewed cup of coffee. That’s exactly how I felt diving into the pages of *Hyunam-dong Bookshop*. This unexpected journey began when I saw this book in a fellow bookworm’s hand during a Secret Santa exchange. A small note inside the book by the previous reader said this provided wisdom and acceptance. Naturally, my curiosity got the better of me, and I delved into the digital version of this book.

Somehow, I got hooked from the very first page — which is rare for me, as I usually take time to warm up to a new book.

Basically, this is a story about a woman named **Yeongju**, who is fed up with her life and decides to open a bookshop — her childhood dream — in hopes of rediscovering the cheerful, book-loving version of herself that she had lost.

The writing is so cozy. Again, I never knew that writing could *feel* a certain way. But the author's words felt like a warm cup of coffee during a gentle rain. I had this feeling the entire time I was reading.

Each chapter reflects different parts and phases of life. The complexity of life is written about so simply, without stripping away its depth. It’s especially wonderful to see that the author explores life from various perspectives — an overworked employee, a jobless top graduate, a teenager, a corporate worker — and more.

It's so beautifully written that I felt like the bookstore was in my own neighborhood. I could imagine myself dropping by, listening to the people who work there, talk there, live there. The writing delicately handles everyday life, human connections, and quiet struggles.

### My favorite line from the book:

> “Dissonance before moments of harmony makes the harmony sound beautiful. Just as harmony and dissonance exist side by side in music, life is the same. Because harmony is preceded by dissonance, that’s why we think life is beautiful.”

This line was beautifully written by the character **Seymour**, and I found it through this book. Just thinking of how writing can work wonders — and how one book can lead us to other gems — makes me feel blessed. I get to live to experience these moments.

This book connected with me on many levels — maybe because I'm at a similar point in my life. It gave me a new perspective, and a kind of comfort I haven’t been able to find around me. It makes me feel like I *can* try more, and don’t need to be afraid of what others think. That it’s okay to be more selfish.

### Final Thoughts

I think it’s a wonderful, cozy read — but I also don’t think it’s for everyone. Some might feel like it leans into self-help or non-fiction territory. It doesn’t have major plot points or twists — it’s more of a quiet, reflective read. A literary warm blanket.
