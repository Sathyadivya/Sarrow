# 24-Year-Old Teenager

I wake up late — it’s **12:03**,  
Alarm’s been screaming more than me.  
My soul’s still snoring on the bed,  
While I make deals inside my head:

> “Five more minutes, skip the shower,  
> Brush my teeth? Don’t have that power.”

I look in the mirror — tragic sight,  
Mascara smudged from last night’s fight  
*(with Netflix, snacks, and ancient dread  
of all the texts I left on read).*

I throw my hair into a knot,  
Call it *"chic"* — it's really not.  
Missed the bus? Oh what a thrill,  
Guess I’ll Uber... or just chill.

I eat some cereal with a fork,  
No clean spoons, and I won’t fork  
over cash for real adult things —  
like rent, or chairs, or napkin rings.

A call comes in — I fake a grin,  
“Hi yes, I’ve totally clocked in!”  
Meanwhile, I’m still in my bed,  
With crumbs of chips stuck to my head.

I’m **24** but still in teens,  
Living life between the memes.  
Taxes? Loans? I just say “Yikes!”  
Then ride away... on training bikes.
