# Endless Applications, Empty Inboxes

The turmoil of thoughts during never-ending job hunting can feel like an exhausting emotional rollercoaster. You might cycle through **hope**, **doubt**, **frustration**, and **determination** all in the same day.

There's the initial optimism that comes with sending applicationsâ€”a sense of possibility in each new opportunity. But as time drags on, **self-doubt creeps in**:  
*Am I doing enough? Am I qualified enough?*

Worse, the path forward starts to feel like **wandering down a road with no clear destination in sight**. Itâ€™s disorientingâ€”everyone else seems to have a well-defined path. Programmers, product managers, and designers all have specific goals and clear steps to take.  

Meanwhile, Iâ€™m out here **throwing darts at a wall**, hoping one hits the bullseye.

Looking back, it almost feels like Iâ€™ve been doing **random things**â€”trying out different roles, courses, and approachesâ€”all without a real sense of direction. Thereâ€™s no specific career path Iâ€™ve followed, no clear trajectory to where I want to go.

Everyone around me seems to have their act together, chasing roles in fields where theyâ€™ve gained **years of experience** and **specialized knowledge**.

I, on the other hand, seem to be **casting a wide net**, hoping somethingâ€”anythingâ€”sticks.

After feeling lost in the job search wilderness for so long, I finally decided to pursue a course in science, thinking it might give me some clarity or a sense of direction. And while itâ€™s helping me gain some skills, the nagging doubt is always there, whispering:

> *What are you even applying for? Where is this heading?*

Itâ€™s like trying to solve a puzzle without knowing what the final picture should look like.  
Everyone else seems to be piecing theirs together, while Iâ€™m stuck shuffling pieces with no frame, no corners, no clues. And itâ€™s draining.

The job hunt isnâ€™t just about searching for employment anymoreâ€”**itâ€™s about searching for a purpose**, for some kind of validation that Iâ€™m on the right track, even if that track is winding, messy, and full of detours.

Itâ€™s not that I believe everyone around me has it all figured outâ€”I know people have their own uncertainties. But at the very least, they seem to have one thing I donâ€™t: **a clear idea of what role they should be applying for**.  

They might be unsure of their next steps, but they know what they're stepping into.

Me?  
Iâ€™m out here applying for jobs I donâ€™t even fully qualify for, hoping something will click.  
And itâ€™s that uncertaintyâ€”*what role am I even suited for?*â€”that makes this whole process feel so much heavier.

Itâ€™s like trying to win a game when I donâ€™t even know the rules.  
Iâ€™m not just struggling with whether or not Iâ€™m good enoughâ€”  
**Iâ€™m struggling to figure out what Iâ€™m even supposed to be good at.**

Meanwhile, Iâ€™m watching others who at least have that baseline certaintyâ€”theyâ€™re applying for project manager roles because thatâ€™s what theyâ€™ve trained for, or theyâ€™re software engineers who know their path, even if the competition is tough.

But me? I feel like Iâ€™m spinning the wheel of fortune, hoping to land on something that makes sense.

And to make things worse?  
The job market itself.  
Itâ€™s not just a matter of finding a role that fits anymore.  

Iâ€™m competing with people who have **20+ years of experience** and are still getting rejected for not meeting *some* requirement.

Itâ€™s a rollercoasterâ€”  
One minute Iâ€™m motivated, thinking Iâ€™ll land the perfect role,  
And the next, Iâ€™m questioning whether Iâ€™ll ever find something where I can genuinely add value.

### ðŸ”„ For now...

Itâ€™s back to the grindâ€”  
Back to sending out applications and hoping for that one moment when it all clicksâ€”  
When the abyss of endless job hunting finally shows a glimmer of light.

Until then, Iâ€™ll keep spiralling, but maybe with a little less panic  
and a little more faith that the path, as undefined as it may be,  
**is still worth walking**.

Alrighty folks!!! Thatâ€™s all for the depressed ranting about my quarter-life crisis.

Letâ€™s see where this wild ride takes us nextâ€”  
Maybe to a job, maybe just to more coffee and existential dread.

**Bye-bye for now! â˜•ðŸŒ€**
